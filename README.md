## Introduction

The Sun Tracking Solar Panel System is designed to automatically adjust the orientation of a solar panel based on the position of the sun. By utilizing LDRs to sense light intensity and an Arduino-controlled servo motor, the system optimizes solar energy collection throughout the day, enhancing overall energy efficiency.

## Demo

[Insert a brief description of the demo here. You can also include images or videos to showcase the project in action.]

## Circuit Diagram

[Insert a brief explanation of the circuit diagram. You can provide details about how LDRs, Arduino, and the servo motor are connected and their functions.]

## Simulation

You can simulate the Sun Tracking Solar Panel System using [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/). Click [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/simulator/your-simulation-link) to access the simulation.

[Provide instructions on how to use the simulation link and interact with the simulated project.]

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the Sun Tracking Solar Panel System:

1. [Insert step-by-step setup instructions here. This can include information about hardware connections, software installation, and code uploading.]

2. [Explain how the LDRs detect light intensity and the Arduino processes this information to control the servo motor's orientation.]

3. [Provide guidance on how to calibrate the system for optimal sun tracking performance.]
